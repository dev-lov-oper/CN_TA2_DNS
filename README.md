This project focuses on analyzing DNS traffic to detect potential security threats, 
such as DNS tunneling and data exfiltration. By monitoring DNS queries—especially those with unusually long or
encoded subdomains—the system aims to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate unauthorized data transfer. 
The toolkit leverages network packet analysis tools and provides insights for improving network security and monitoring.
